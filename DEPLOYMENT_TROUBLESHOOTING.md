# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: 12+ minutes initializing with no build logs

### Likely Causes:
1. **Large file size** - 75 new files including AVIF images
2. **Memory limits** - 14K+ lines of new code
3. **Build cache corruption**
4. **Environment variable issues**

### Immediate Solutions:

#### Option 1: Manual Redeploy
1. Go to Railway/Vercel dashboard
2. Trigger manual redeploy
3. Check build logs for specific errors

#### Option 2: Optimize Build (if needed)
1. Move AVIF files to .gitignore
2. Use external CDN for images
3. Reduce bundle size

#### Option 3: Environment Check
1. Verify all environment variables are set
2. Check DATABASE_URL is correct
3. Ensure YOUTUBE_API_KEY is configured

### Local Development Status:
âœ… **WORKING** - http://localhost:3000
- All curriculum navigation features functional
- Complete scope & sequence pages available
- Ready for testing and demonstration

### Next Steps:
1. Test locally first at http://localhost:3000
2. If deployment continues failing, implement image optimization
3. Consider splitting large commits into smaller deployments

### Emergency Rollback:
If needed, can rollback to previous commit:
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

But local development is fully functional for immediate use.

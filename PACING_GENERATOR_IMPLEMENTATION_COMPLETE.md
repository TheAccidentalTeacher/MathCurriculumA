  - Interactive weekly detail expansion with keyboard support
  - Export functionality (PDF, CSV, JSON) with accessibility announcements
  - Comprehensive visualization of generated pacing guides

### Phase 4: API Integration ‚úÖ
- **API Route** (`src/app/api/pacing/generate/route.ts`)
  - RESTful endpoint with comprehensive validation
  - Error handling with development vs production error exposure
  - OpenAI API key validation and service integration
  - Structured request/response handling

### Phase 5: Main Application Page ‚úÖ

- **Flexible Timeframes**: Quarter, semester, trimester, and full-year options

### Comprehensive Output
- **Weekly Schedules**: Detailed lesson plans with standards alignment
- **Assessment Planning**: Formative and summative assessment schedules
- **Differentiation Strategies**: Population-specific modifications and resources
- **Standards Alignment**: Complete mapping of when standards are addressed

### Export Capabilities
- **Multiple Formats**: PDF (print-ready), CSV (data analysis), JSON (programmatic access)
- **Accessibility Features**: Screen reader announcements for export status

## üêõ Issues Resolved

### Build System Fixes
- **Infinite Render Loops**: Fixed in `verification/page.tsx` and `comprehensive-diagnostic/page.tsx`
- **Prisma Schema Alignment**: Updated services to match actual database schema
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Resolved all type errors and null handling issues

### Performance Optimizations
- **Memoization**: Used `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Connection Management**: Proper cleanup of database and AI service connections
- **State Management**: Efficient state updates without render loops

## üìä Testing Results

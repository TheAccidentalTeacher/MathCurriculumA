Diana is\ndedicated to helping Latina women like her become leaders\nin science.\nWhen Diana was 17, she moved to the United\nStates on her own. Diana stayed with her\naunt, took English lessons, and worked so\nshe could pay for expenses. She sometimes\ntook six buses to get to school.\nDiana Trujillo\nwas born in\n1983 in the\nSouth American\nnation of\nColombia. As a\nchild, she loved\ngazing at the sky\nand dreamed of\nlearning more\nabout space.\nAfter college, Diana attended the\nNational Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration (NASA) Academy. In\n2008, she began working for NASA as\nan aerospace engineer.\nWhen it came time to declare her major in college,\nDiana chose aerospace engineering. Diana was\ninspired by astronauts who were women of color,\nincluding Kalpana Chawla. Diana dedicated herself\nto becoming one of these groundbreaking women.\n©Curriculum Associates, LLC Copying is not permitted.UNIT 5 STEM Stories434ST\nMath Practice 5 Connection\nDiana Trujillo uses tools in a strategic way in her work on specialized space equipment.\nShe and her team spent years perfecting the Mars rover’s arm, which collects rock and\nsoil samples to analyze.",

The equation 4 1 5 5 6 1 3 shows that\nthese two different numerical expressions have the same value.\nSometimes equations have variables that stand for unknown numbers. An\nequation is true when its two sides have the same value. A value of a variable that\nmakes an equation true is a solution of an equation. For example, the equation\nx 1 3 5 5 has a solution of 2 because 2 1 3 5 5 is a true statement.\nYour student will be learning to model solutions of equations like the one below.\nShow that 3 is a solution of the equation 4 5 x 1 1.\n\u0007➤\nONE WAY to show that a number is a solution of an equation is to represent the\nequation with a bar model.\n1x",

The inequality for the Standard tour uses a symbol that\ncombines the less than symbol (,) with the equal sign (5). Why do you need to\nuse equal to, as well as less than, when describing all possible values for s?\nWhy does the inequality for the Advanced tour use only the less than symbol?\nLook at the second\nModel It. Why does one graph have a closed circle at the end\nof the arrow, while the other graph has an open circle?\nRaúl uses a greater than or equal to symbol ($) to write the inequality 16 $ s.\nDoes this inequality also represent the graph for the Standard tour?

Explain how you know.\nLook Ahead One way to find the distances between the locations on the\nsnowshoe trails is to model the problem on the axes in a coordinate plane. You\ncan find the distance between two points on an axis by using the distances of the\npoints from the origin.\na.   Points   A and B are on the y-axis. They are on opposite sides of the\norigin. How many units is each of these points from the origin?\nb.  To find the distance between points A and B, do you add their\ndistances from the origin or subtract them? Why?\nc.   Points   C and D are on the x-axis. They are on the same side of the origin. How\nmany units is each of these points from the origin?\nd.  To find the distance between points C and D, do you add their distances from\nthe origin or subtract them? Why?\nReflect How can you determine the distance between any two points on an axis\nby using their distances from the origin?",

Explain how you know.\nLook Ahead When working with large data sets, it is sometimes helpful to\nshow the frequencies of groups of data values instead of individual values.\nA histogram organizes data values into equal-size intervals of the number line.\nA bar is used to show how many data values are in each interval.\na. This histogram shows the distribution of\nages of visitors at a science museum at noon\non one day. The first bar represents visitors in\nthe age group 0–9, the second bar\nrepresents visitors in the age group 10–19,\nand so on. How many visitors are in the age\ngroup 0–9? How do you know?\nb.  Two visitors at the museum are 70 years old. Which bar includes these visitors?\nc.   Can you use the histogram to tell how many visitors are 13 years old? Explain.\nd.  The size of the age interval for each bar is the number of years included in the\ninterval. What is the size of the age intervals in the histogram?\nReflect Suppose you make the interval size in the histogram twice as large. How\nwould this change affect the histogram?",

Explain how you can answer this question.\nLook Ahead In the Tr y I t problem, you chose one number to represent a\ntypical amount of sugar in a serving of yogurt. When you use a single value to\nsummarize a data set, you are using a measure of center. One measure of center\nis the median, or middle value when the data values are listed in order.\na. The table shows the number of grams of sugar in one serving of\ndifferent drinks. List the values in order from least to greatest. What is\nthe middle value of the data set? Describe how you found it.\nb. What is the median number of grams of sugar in a drink? How do you know?\nc.   The median splits the data into two halves.

Then solve problems 1–8.\nExample\nOn Fridays, the mean amount a smoothie shop makes in sales is\n$2,287, with a MAD of $314. On Saturdays, the mean amount the\nshop makes in sales is $1,934, with a MAD of $152. On which of the\ntwo days does the shop typically make more money? On which day\nare the sales generally more consistent?\nLook at how you could interpret the means and MADs.\nThe mean is a measure of center, so it can represent a typical\nvalue in a data set. The mean sales for Fridays are greater than\nthe mean sales for Saturdays.\nThe MAD is a measure of variability. The less variability a data\nset has, the more consistent the data values are. The MAD for\nSaturdays is less than the MAD for Fridays.\nSOLUTION\nApply It\nNoe sells lemonade to raise money for multiple\nsclerosis research. He collects data on the price\nof lemonade at other lemonade stands. He\nuses the mean of the data as the price of\nlemonade at his stand. What is the price of\nlemonade at Noe’s stand? Show your work.\nSOLUTION\nCONSIDER THIS . . .\nThe more consistent the\nvalues in a data set are,\nthe closer the values are\nto each other.\nPAIR/SHARE\nWould it be unusual\nfor the shop to make\n$2,500 in sales on a\nFriday?

Well, this reporter decided to find out. The dot plot\nshows the survey results of 26 students at our school. Each student was\nasked how much time he or she spent using screens on Saturday.\nBased on the survey, the median amount of screen time was 3 hours.\nSo, about half the students used screens 3 hours or less and about half\nused screens 3 hours or more.\nAs you can see from the dot plot, the screen times varied from 0 hours\nto a nearly unbelievable 11 hours! The middle half of the data set\nranged from 2 hours of screen time to 6 hours of screen time.\nIn conclusion, the surveyed students typically spent about 3 hours on\nSaturday staring at screens, but there was quite a bit of variability in\ntheir screen use.\nFinally, I will check that I met the requirements of the article.\nThe first paragraph includes my statistical question, I made a dot plot\nto display the data, I described the data using the median and IQR, and\nthe last paragraph answers the statistical question.\n©Curriculum Associates, LLC Copying is not permitted.UNIT 7   Math in Action  Statistical Questions and Measures of Center and Variability756\nUNIT\n7 Math in Action\nProblem-Solving\nChecklist\nTell what is known.\nTell what the\nproblem is asking.\nShow all your work.\nShow that the\nsolution works.\nSESSION 1\nTry Another Approach\n\u0007➤\nThere are many ways to solve problems.

The equation 4 1 5 5 6 1 3 shows that\nthese two different numerical expressions have the same value.\nSometimes equations have variables that stand for unknown numbers. An\nequation is true when its two sides have the same value. A value of a variable that\nmakes an equation true is a solution of an equation. For example, the equation\nx 1 3 5 5 has a solution of 2 because 2 1 3 5 5 is a true statement.\nYour student will be learning to model solutions of equations like the one below.\nShow that 3 is a solution of the equation 4 5 x 1 1.\n\u0007➤\nONE WAY to show that a number is a solution of an equation is to represent the\nequation with a bar model.\n1x",

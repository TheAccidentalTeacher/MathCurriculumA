His work shaped current scientific\nunderstanding of severe weather, including tornadoes,\ntyphoons, and thunderstorms. That greater understanding\nhelps keep people safe.\nTed studied mechanical engineering in\ncollege. He became a professor of physics\nand also helped make weather maps. He\nanalyzed typhoons and earned a doctorate.\nIn 1947, Ted hiked to a weather observation\nstation at the top of a mountain to gather\ndata about an approaching thunderstorm.\nTed Fujita was born\nin 1920 in Japan. As\na young person, Ted\nwas fascinated by\nthe natural world.\nYoung Ted often dug for clams on the beach at low\ntide. He became interested in astronomy when he\nlearned the position of the moon affects the ocean.\n©Curriculum Associates, LLC Copying is not permitted.UNIT 1 STEM Stories2ST\nMath Practice 7 Connection\nTed spent years gathering data about tornadoes and looking for patterns and structure.\nHe used the structure and patterns he found in the data to develop the Fujita scale.",

For example, the GCF of 12 and 18 is 6.\nFactors of 12:  1,  2,  3,  4,  6,  12\nFactors of 18:  1,  2,  3,  6,  9,  18\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the least multiple that the\ntwo numbers share. For example, the LCM of 12 and 18 is 36.\nMultiples of 12:  12,  24,  36,  48,  . . .\nMultiples of 18:  18,  36,  54,  . . .\nYour student will be learning to use the greatest common factor to solve problems\nlike the one below.\nA teacher gives out 30 markers and 40 colored pencils. He gives an equal\nnumber of markers and an equal number of colored pencils to each\nstudent. What is the greatest number of students the teacher can give\nmarkers and colored pencils to?\n\u0007➤\nONE WAY to find the greatest common factor of two whole numbers is to list all\nthe factors of each number.\nFactors of 30:  1,  2,  3,  5,  6,  10,  15,  30\nFactors of 40:  1,  2,  4,  5,  8,  10,  20, 40\nThe common factors of 30 and 40 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The greatest common\nfactor is 10.\n\u0007➤\nANOTHER WAY is to write each number as a product of prime factors.\nThen multiply the common prime factors.\n30     5 3 • 2 • 5                  40                  5 2 • 2 • 2 • 5\nGreatest common factor: 2 • 5 5 10\nUsing either method, the greatest number of students the\nteacher can give an equal number of markers and an equal\nnumber of colored pencils to is 10.\nUse the next page to start a\nconversation about factors.\n©Curriculum Associates, LLC Copying is not permitted.LESSON 6 Find Greatest Common Factor and Least Common Multiple108\nLESSON 6 | FIND GREATEST COMMON FACTOR AND LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE\nActivity Exploring Common Factors\n\u0007➤\nDo this activity together to explore common factors.\nYou are helping with the 6th grade spirit day at\nschool.

His work shaped current scientific\nunderstanding of severe weather, including tornadoes,\ntyphoons, and thunderstorms. That greater understanding\nhelps keep people safe.\nTed studied mechanical engineering in\ncollege. He became a professor of physics\nand also helped make weather maps. He\nanalyzed typhoons and earned a doctorate.\nIn 1947, Ted hiked to a weather observation\nstation at the top of a mountain to gather\ndata about an approaching thunderstorm.\nTed Fujita was born\nin 1920 in Japan. As\na young person, Ted\nwas fascinated by\nthe natural world.\nYoung Ted often dug for clams on the beach at low\ntide. He became interested in astronomy when he\nlearned the position of the moon affects the ocean.\n©Curriculum Associates, LLC Copying is not permitted.UNIT 1 STEM Stories2ST\nMath Practice 7 Connection\nTed spent years gathering data about tornadoes and looking for patterns and structure.\nHe used the structure and patterns he found in the data to develop the Fujita scale.",

Ted moved\nto the U.S. with his family.\nIn 1957 a tornado struck Fargo, North Dakota. Ted\ncollected and carefully studied nearly 200\nphotographs to better understand the tornado.\nTed was so focused on tornadoes that people\ncalled him “Mr. Tornado.” After studying them\nfor nearly 30 years, Ted finally saw a tornado\nin 1982! Because of his focus, we know a lot\nabout tornadoes and how to keep people safe\nduring storms.\nWith help from others, Ted studied many\ntornado sites. Ted and his wife, Sumiko, used\nwhat they learned to create the Fujita scale\nin 1971.

For example, the GCF of 12 and 18 is 6.\nFactors of 12:  1,  2,  3,  4,  6,  12\nFactors of 18:  1,  2,  3,  6,  9,  18\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the least multiple that the\ntwo numbers share. For example, the LCM of 12 and 18 is 36.\nMultiples of 12:  12,  24,  36,  48,  . . .\nMultiples of 18:  18,  36,  54,  . . .\nYour student will be learning to use the greatest common factor to solve problems\nlike the one below.\nA teacher gives out 30 markers and 40 colored pencils. He gives an equal\nnumber of markers and an equal number of colored pencils to each\nstudent. What is the greatest number of students the teacher can give\nmarkers and colored pencils to?\n\u0007➤\nONE WAY to find the greatest common factor of two whole numbers is to list all\nthe factors of each number.\nFactors of 30:  1,  2,  3,  5,  6,  10,  15,  30\nFactors of 40:  1,  2,  4,  5,  8,  10,  20, 40\nThe common factors of 30 and 40 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The greatest common\nfactor is 10.\n\u0007➤\nANOTHER WAY is to write each number as a product of prime factors.\nThen multiply the common prime factors.\n30     5 3 • 2 • 5                  40                  5 2 • 2 • 2 • 5\nGreatest common factor: 2 • 5 5 10\nUsing either method, the greatest number of students the\nteacher can give an equal number of markers and an equal\nnumber of colored pencils to is 10.\nUse the next page to start a\nconversation about factors.\n©Curriculum Associates, LLC Copying is not permitted.LESSON 6 Find Greatest Common Factor and Least Common Multiple108\nLESSON 6 | FIND GREATEST COMMON FACTOR AND LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE\nActivity Exploring Common Factors\n\u0007➤\nDo this activity together to explore common factors.\nYou are helping with the 6th grade spirit day at\nschool.

He already has\n4 leghorns and 8 orpingtons. I will suggest that Juan have 10 leghorns\nand 15 orpingtons, for a total of 25 hens. Because 10 ] 4 5 6 and\n15 ] 8 5 7, Juan should buy 6 leghorns and 7 orpingtons.\nNext, I need to determine the number of hens Juan can keep\nin each pen.\nI want to have as many hens as possible in each pen, so I will find the\nGCF of 10 and 15.\nFactors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10\nFactors of 15: 1, 3, 5, 15                          Each pen can hold 5 hens.\nThen, I will find how many pens are needed.\nThere are 5 hens in each pen. That means 2 pens will be for leghorns\nand 3 pens will be for orpingtons. Because 2 1 3 5 5, Juan needs\n5 pens in all.\nNow, I can design the pens.\nI know that each pen needs to be at least 4 feet high. I can make each\npen in the shape of a rectangular prism with a height of 4 feet.\nI also know that each hen needs at least 8 square feet of floor space, so\neach pen needs a floor area of 8 • 5, or 40 square feet. I can make the\nfloor of each pen a rectangle with dimensions 8 feet by 5 feet.\nI can show my work by drawing a sketch of a pen.\n8 \u001d\n5 \u001d\n4 \u001d\nNOTICE THAT . . .\nWhen choosing how\nmany hens to buy, think\nabout whether the total\nnumbers of each type\nof hen will have any\ncommon factors.\nNOTICE THAT . . .\nThe number of leghorns\nand orpingtons needs\nto be considered to\ndetermine the number\nof pens needed.\nRemember that each\npen will contain only\none type of hen.\n©Curriculum Associates, LLC Copying is not permitted.UNIT 1   Math in Action  Area, Surface Area, and Algebraic Expressions131\nFinally, I will use surface area to find how much chicken wire\nis needed.\nI can find the areas of the top and side faces, and then add these areas\ntogether.

A ratio is a way of comparing\nquantities. Sometimes ratios compare a part and a part, and sometimes they\ncompare a part and a whole.\nFor example, when making a total of 3 cups of lemonade, you might say:\n•   The ratio of cups of water to cups of lemon juice is 2 to 1.\n•   The ratio of cups of water to total cups of lemonade is 2 to 3.\nYour student will be modeling ratios like the one below.\nTo make a purple paint, you can use 3 cups of blue paint for every 2 cups\nof red paint.\n\u0007➤\nONE WAY to model a ratio relationship is to use a diagram.\nBlue paint\nRed paint\n\u0007➤\nANOTHER WAY is to use ratio language and symbols.\nThe ratio of cups of blue paint to cups of red paint is\n3 to 2     or     3 : 2\nbecause there are 3 cups of blue paint for every 2 cups of red paint.\nYou can also change the order of the parts so that the amount of red paint is the\nfirst quantity in the ratio.\nThe ratio of cups of red paint to cups of blue paint is\n2 to 3     or     2 : 3\nbecause there are 2 cups of red paint for every 3 cups of blue paint.\nBoth representations accurately compare the quantities of blue paint and\nred paint.\nUnderstand Ratio Concepts",

If not, explain why\nthe estimates are different and whether they are both reasonable.\nUNIT 4   Math in Action  Rates, Unit Rates, and Percents427©Curriculum Associates, LLC Copying is not permitted.\n©Curriculum Associates, LLC Copying is not permitted.428UNIT 4   Self Reflection  Ratio Reasoning: Unit Rates and Percent\nUNIT\n4 Self Reflection\nIn this unit you learned to . . .\nSkillLesson\nCompare rates to solve real-world problems.15, 16\nUse unit rates to find equivalent ratios.16\nConvert measurement units using rates.16\nExpress a percent as a decimal or a fraction.17, 18\nFind a given percent of a number.17, 18\nFind what percent one number is of another number.17, 18\nFind the whole when given a part and a percent.18\nUse math vocabulary and precise language to explain ratios, rates, and percents.15–18\nThink about what you have learned.\n\u0007➤\nUse words, numbers, and drawings.\nThe most important math I learned was                                because . . .\nThe hardest thing I learned to do was                                because . . .\nI could use more practice with . . .",

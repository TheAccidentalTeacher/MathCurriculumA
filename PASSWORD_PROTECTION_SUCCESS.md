## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Authentication Flow:**
1. User visits `/pacing-generator`
2. If not authenticated, shows password form
3. User enters password "abc123"
4. If correct, grants access and saves session state
5. If incorrect, shows error and clears input
6. Authenticated users see full pacing generator interface
7. Logout button allows users to exit protected area

### **Security Notes:**
- This is **basic protection** suitable for internal use
- Password is client-side only (not secure against determined attackers)
- Session-based authentication (clears when browser closes)
- Suitable for preventing casual access, not high-security applications

  - Open-ended problems
  - Multiple solution pathways encouraged
  - Student reasoning and discussion emphasized
  - Examples: "Explore Unit Rates for Ratios with Fractions", "Explore Rigid Transformations"

#### 2. **Develop Phase** 
- **Purpose**: Build understanding through guided instruction
- **Structure**: "Develop [Specific Skill/Concept]"
- **Characteristics**:
  - Structured examples and modeling
  - Step-by-step problem solving
  - Concept building activities
  - Examples: "Develop Using Scale to Find Distances", "Develop Understanding of Rigid Transformations"

#### 3. **Refine Phase**
- **Purpose**: Practice, apply, and solidify learning
- **Structure**: "Refine [Topic]" 
- **Characteristics**:
  - Problem sets for fluency
  - Application problems
  - Assessment preparation
  - Examples: "Refine Solving Problems Involving Scale", "Refine Ideas About Rigid Transformations"

## Lesson Architecture

### Session Structure
Many lessons are organized into multiple sessions:

**Grade 7 Example - Lesson 2: Find Unit Rates Involving Ratios of Fractions**
- SESSION 1: Explore Unit Rates for Ratios with Fractions
- SESSION 2: Develop Solving Problems with Unit Rates 
- SESSION 3: Refine Finding Unit Rates Involving Ratios of Fractions

**Grade 8 Example - Lesson 1: Understand Rigid Transformations**  
- SESSION 1: Explore Rigid Transformations
- SESSION 2: Develop Understanding of Rigid Transformations and Their Properties
- SESSION 3: Refine Ideas About Rigid Transformations and Their Properties

### Unit Organization

**Grade 7 Volume 1 Units:**
- Unit 1: Proportional Relationships: Ratios, Rates, and Circles
- Unit 2: Rational Number Operations
- Unit 3: Expressions and Equations

**Grade 8 Volume 1 Units:**
- Unit 1: Transformations and Angle Relationships  
- Unit 2: Linear Relationships
- Unit 3: Functions

## Key Curriculum Features

### 1. **Family Communication**
- "Dear Family" letters for each lesson
- Explanation of concepts being learned
- Home support suggestions

### 2. **Prerequisite Preparation**  
- "Prepare for [Topic]" sections
- Skills review before new concepts
- Connection to prior learning

### 3. **Practice Structure**
- Graduated difficulty levels
- Real-world applications
- Multiple representations (visual, algebraic, verbal)

### 4. **Assessment Integration**
- Formative assessment opportunities embedded
- "Look Back" and "Look Ahead" components
- Unit reviews and vocabulary sections

## Content Progression Examples

### Grade 7 Lesson 1: Scale Problems
1. **Introduction**: Museum postcards scaling problem
2. **Explore**: Different methods for finding actual lengths
3. **Develop**: Systematic approaches to scale calculations
4. **Practice**: Graduated problems (distances → areas → redrawing)
5. **Refine**: Complex applications and problem solving

### Grade 8 Lesson 1: Rigid Transformations
1. **Explore**: Discovery of transformation properties
2. **Develop**: Formal understanding of transformations
3. **Multiple Sessions**: Deep dive into translations, reflections, rotations
4. **Refine**: Application and consolidation

## Mathematical Practices Integration

The curriculum consistently emphasizes:
- Problem-solving and perseverance
- Mathematical reasoning and proof
- Modeling with mathematics
- Using appropriate tools strategically
- Attending to precision
- Looking for structure and patterns

## Assessment Philosophy

- **Formative**: Continuous checking for understanding
- **Authentic**: Real-world problem contexts
- **Multi-modal**: Various ways to demonstrate understanding
- **Reflective**: "Look Back" components for metacognition

## Technology Integration

- Digital resources referenced throughout
- Interactive practice opportunities
- Geometry tools and learning games
- Personalized instruction components

## Implications for Academic Pathway Design

This curriculum structure suggests several key principles for accelerated pathway design:

1. **Maintain Pedagogical Integrity**: The Explore-Develop-Refine cycle should be preserved even in accelerated pacing
2. **Session Flexibility**: Multi-session lessons can be condensed while maintaining essential elements
3. **Prerequisite Attention**: "Prepare for" sections are crucial for identifying readiness gaps
4. **Spiral Review**: Built-in connections to prior learning support acceleration
5. **Assessment Alignment**: Embedded formative assessments help identify students ready for acceleration

This analysis provides the foundation for designing an academic pathway system that respects the curriculum's pedagogical approach while enabling flexible pacing and personalized learning paths.

## 🔍 PHASE 1: SYSTEMATIC CONTENT ANALYSIS

### 1.1 Curriculum Structure Recognition

**Objective**: Understand the consistent patterns across all volumes

#### Ready Classroom Mathematics Structure Pattern:
```
VOLUME (V1/V2)
├── UNIT A: [Theme Name]
│   ├── LESSON 1: [Title]
│   │   ├── SESSION 1: Explore [Concept]
│   │   ├── SESSION 2: Develop [Skill]
│   │   └── SESSION 3: Refine [Application]
│   └── LESSON 2: [Title]
└── UNIT B: [Theme Name]
```

#### Standards Integration Pattern:
- Each lesson maps to Common Core State Standards
- Major Work vs. Supporting Work classification
- Grade-level progressions and prerequisites

### 1.2 Page-Level Content Classification

**Visual Recognition Training Data:**

| Page Type | Visual Indicators | Content Extraction Priority |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Unit Opener | Large unit title, overview diagram | HIGH - Scope/sequence mapping |
| Lesson Opener | "LESSON X" header, standards list | CRITICAL - Lesson metadata |
| Session Page | "SESSION X" subheader, activity boxes | CRITICAL - Learning activities |
| Practice Page | Problem numbers, exercise grids | HIGH - Assessment content |
| Assessment | "UNIT X Assessment" header | HIGH - Evaluation criteria |
